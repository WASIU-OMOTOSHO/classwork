								<h4>I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks, I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also master the soft skills required for being a software developer</p>
								So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a software developer.</h4>

			<h4>Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really different from the self learning I started with. The learning was fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.</h4>

I wasn't disappointed, the environment was well ventilated and conducive, with competent instructors. Here I am today at OT&T Consulting, fulfilling my dreams thanks to Tech Studio Academy.</h4>
